# Fundamentals of sites and hierarchies for Configuration Manager.

### A Configuration Manager deployment must be installed in an Active Directory domain.  
### The foundation of this deployment includes one or more Configuration Manager sites that form a hierarchy of sites.  
### From a single site to a multi-site hierarchy, the type and location of sites you install provide the ability to scale up (expand) your deployment when necessary and deliver key services to managed users and devices.
